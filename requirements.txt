# Note: CUDA-specific dependencies should be installed separately if not already present:
# - torch >= 2.3.1 (with CUDA)
# - spconv-cu120 or spconv-cu118 (depending on CUDA version)
# - torch_scatter, torch_cluster (from PyG)
# - flash_attn (optional but recommended)
# These are typically already installed in the conda environment
